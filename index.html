  <h2>Motivation</h2>

  <p>Open source software development operates fundamentally differently
	from corporate software engineering. In recent years, the introduction
	of non-technical ideologies - whether large-scale political positions
	or smaller interpersonal dynamics around recognition and status - has
	repeatedly proven detrimental to the sustainability and cohesion of
	open source projects.</p>

  <p>In response, some communities have chosen to forgo codes of conduct
	entirely. However, the absence of a formal code does not eliminate
	governance structures - often, it merely obscures them or leaves room
	for unofficial, potentially harmful ones to emerge. Even in projects
	that reject centralized authority, bad actors can still manufacture
	the appearance of power, presenting themselves as representatives or
	moderators without legitimacy.</p>

  <p>Rather than remain silent on these issues, we choose to take a clear
	and deliberate stance. We explicitly affirm our commitment to
	neutrality, to merit-based evaluation, and to the rejection of
	authority structures that can be co-opted or abused. This code of
	conduct serves not as a tool of control, but as a safeguard against
	it.</p>

  <h2>How to Adopt</h2>
  
  <p>Any explicit confirmation of adoption is sufficient. While the
	common practice is to include the text in a file
	titled <code>CODE_OF_CONDUCT</code> in the top-level directory of
	the code repository, in the most simple case, a declaration like
	"This project adopts the Aegis Code of Conduct" or even very short declarations like
	"CoC: Aegis-2-Clause" will suffice. Either way, we kindly ask you
	provide a link to this website, especially in the latter case
	where the actual content of the Code isn't immediately
	available.</p>

  <p>Unlike others, we will never ask you to donate to us for
	adopting the Aegis Code of Conduct. However, if you still wish to show
	your support and are insistent on doing so, we kindly ask that you direct
	your contributions to other projects you find useful and deserving.</p>
