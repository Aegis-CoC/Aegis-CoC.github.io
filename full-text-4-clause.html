	<li><b>Maintain Technological Focus and Ideological Neutrality.</b> This
   project is committed to technological excellence and neutrality. We
   do not take positions on political, ideological, or social issues
   in the name of the development team. Accordingly, please refrain
   from making such statements under the project's banner, even if
   they reflect personal beliefs or convictions; such declarations are
   not appropriate within the context of the project and should be
	  kept separate from technical discourse.</li>
	<li><b>Adhere to Merit-Based Evaluation.</b> We evaluate contributions
   based solely on their technical merit and relevance to the
   project. Personal identity, affiliations, or background are not
   factored into this evaluation, and should not be emphasized. Please
   refrain from emphasizing such details within project
   discussions. If, after reading this, you still choose to foreground
   such information, you accept sole responsibility for any resulting
	  consequences or interpretations.</li>
	<li><b>Engage Constructively and Charitably.</b> Avoid making premature
   and/or harsh judgments. If someone proposes an idea they find
   intuitive but appears underdeveloped or difficult to justify, aim
   to understand the underlying intent, refine their proposal and
   strengthen their reasonings with the same level of care you would
   wish for your own ideas. Conversely, if your own proposal is
   rejected, engage with the feedback thoughtfully, and continue the
	  dialogue in a professional and constructive manner.</li>
	<li><b>Practice Empathy and Respect.</b> Treat all contributors with basic
   decency and respect. Every individual brings with them personal
   experiences and challenges that may not be immediately
   visible. Regardless of your current circumstances, please engage
   with others in a way that you would consider fair and considerate
	  under reversed roles.</li>
<p>BY CHOOSING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS PROJECT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
PARTICIPATION DOES NOT ENTITLE YOU TO CREATE OR ASSUME POSITIONS OF
AUTHORITY, GOVERNANCE, OR REPRESENTATION OVER THE PROJECT OR ITS
COMMUNITY. This includes, but is not limited to, establishing
unofficial forums, channels, or subgroups (e.g. subreddits, Discord
servers) where you claim administrative or leadership status in
association with the project. Should you proceed with such
initiatives, they will not be recognized or endorsed by the
development team in any capacity. Furthermore, the development team
explicitly disclaims any role as a moderation body. There will be no
moderation team empowered to control contributions or project
direction beyond technical evaluation and code review. Decisions about
what is included in the project will remain solely merit-based and
  decentralized.</p>
