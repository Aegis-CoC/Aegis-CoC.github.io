  <h2>FAQ</h2>

  <ul>	
	<li>Q: Are codes of conduct a mechanism for turning project governance over to “social justice warriors”?<br />
	  <p>A: This claim can be (and has been) true for some other Codes of Conduct, but it's safe to say this isn't the case for Aegis CoC, since adopting it means denouncing any governing body over the project, which means there wouldn't be any governance for adopters to hand over.</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>Q: Why does the code explicitly rejects the formation of a standing moderation body?<br />
	  
  <p>A: We reject the model of a standing moderation body for several
	practical and ethical reasons:
	<ul>
	  <li>First, requiring technically capable
	contributors to take on moderation duties diverts their time, energy,
	and cognitive focus away from meaningful development work. This is not
	only an inefficient use of talent, but also places an unfair emotional
		and social burden on those individuals.</li>

	  <li>Second, delegating moderation responsibilities to contributors who are
	less technically proficient creates a harmful power imbalance and
	introduces systemic risk to the quality and future of projects. When
	development decisions are subject to the authority of individuals who
	may not possess the technical insight to prioritize the project's real
	needs, the long-term integrity of the software is compromised. In such
	a scenario, core contributors operate under constraints imposed by
		those who may lack both alignment and capability.</li>
	</ul>

  <p>For these reasons, we reject any structure in which moderation becomes
	a centralized power. We believe that open source projects shall
	remains strictly focused on technology, and decisions shall be and
	continue to be based solely on the merit of ideas and implementations.</p>

	</li>

	<li>Q: How does the Code protect against identity-based discrimination?<br />
	  <p>A: Any identity-based discourse is not part of the protected
		speech under the Code, and can thus be subjected to any kind
		of punishment without violating the Code as long as the punishments
		themselves aren't violating the Code (e.g. you can't ban someone 
		from making useful contributions to the project as a
		punishment). Whether there will be punishments is completely
		up to the judgement of the moderation team of the place where
		the discourse happened. The Code itself
		does not guarantee any level of "safety" or "inclusivity"
		beyond the meaning stated above.</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>Q: How are the Exempt Clauses implied?<br />
	  <p>A:
		<ul>
		  <li>The BDFL exempt clause is simply an implication of copyright rather than any other texts, since the copyright owner technically retains full right over his code.</li>
		  <li>Code of Conduct is technically not a technology-related topic and is thus not protected speech; for this reason the development team can choose whatever actions they like.</li>
		</ul>
	  </p>
	</li>
  </ul>
